The life of getpid():
First, getpid() is called in the user space. The declaration for getpid() is in
user.h:
22	int getpid(void);

getpid()'s functionality is defined in usys.S, in assembly:
28	SYSCALL(getpid)
Note that this code will be expanded into the following assembly instructions 
due to the #define at the beginning of the file:
.globl getpid
getpid:
	movl $SYS_getpid, %eax
	int $T_SYSCALL
	ret
This code will define getpid as a global symbol and create a point to jump to.  
$SYS_getpid is a constant, which is defined in syscall.h:
12	#define SYS_getpid 11
Therefore, the value 11 will be passed into the eax register. Then, an interrupt
is triggered via the int command; the specific interrupt handler is $T_SYSCALL,
which is defined in traps.h:
27	#define T_SYSCALL	64
Note: ret will return to the caller of the getpid() function.

Once int is triggered, the execution of the call shifts into Kernel Mode.

The exact location that the interrupt will jump to is defined in the vectors.S
file (which is dynamically created when the kernel is compiled). This is a
vector of all system calls, indexed into via T_SYSCALL in this case. Note that the
line numbers here are assuming that no additional vectors are being generated
aside from those that are made from the original xv6 source:
317	.globl vector64
218	vector64:
219	  pushl $0
220	  pushl $64
221	  jmp alltraps

The alltraps tag is located inside of trapasm.S. This pushes all the data that
the userspace is currently using into a trap, which is then pushed into the
Process Control Block. While the structure of the trapframe is defined in x86.h, the
instance created by alltraps is done so with assembly. Note that:
159	uint eax;
contains the system call number SYS_getpid, which in this case is 11. 

alltraps calls trap(struct trapframe* tf), which is located in trap.c. Because 
tf->trapno == 0, syscall() will be called, which is located in syscall.c:
126	void
127	syscall(void)
128	{
129	 int num;

This will pull the value in eax into num, which should be 11 (for getpid):
131	num = proc->tf->eax;

This will call syscalls[11](), which is an array of function names (the Sycall
Dispatch Table). First, the code ensures that the specified syscall number
actually exists; it must be greater than 0, and it must be less than the total
number of elements inside they syscalls table (provided by NELEM):
133	if(num > 0 && num < NELEM(syscalls) && syscalls[num]) {
134		proc->tf->eax = syscalls[num]();

And in syscalls[]() (also located in syscall.c):
113	[SYS_getpid]  sys_getpid,

This references a declaration further up in syscall.c:
87	extern int sys_getpid(void);

sys_getpid() is defined in sysproc.c:
39	int
40	sys_getpid(void)
41	{
42		return proc->pid;
43	}

The return value of sys_getpid() is returned via the eax register, which is
stored on the stack and will be pushed out upon returning to alltraps.S.
